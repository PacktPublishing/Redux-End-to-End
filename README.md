## About the Video Course
Redux completes the missing piece of the React framework, and is used at the core of React for most complex React projects. In this course, we’ll be focusing on leveraging the Redux framework to impose better engineering on React applications. Redux is an implementation of FLUX, which is a pattern for managing application state in React. Redux brings a clean and testable design to the table using a purely functional approach.

In this course will build an app piece by piece, starting with a minimal webpack application and quickly transforming it into an isomorphic Redux application with full API integration, including secure authentication.
